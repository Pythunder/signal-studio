<P><FONT face="Verdana" >This command records audio to a file. To start a 
recording, use "<SPAN class=cmd><EM>Transport -&gt; Record</EM>"</SPAN>, or 
press "<SPAN class=key><EM>Ctrl+R</EM>" (Keyboard Shortcut)</SPAN>. 
Alternatively you can use the </FONT><A 
href="ALG.08.029.htm"><FONT size=2 face="Verdana" >Toolbar</FONT></A><FONT face="Verdana" >'s record button. </FONT>
<P>  <FONT face=Verdana>First the "<EM>Save Recording As</EM>" file dialog is 
displayed, prompting you to choose a file name and folder for the recording. 
<STRONG>Don't enter a file extension, as only .wav is supported. </STRONG>Press 
"<EM>OK</EM>" to continue.<STRONG> </STRONG></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana" >Next the Record dialog is displayed, prompting you to 
specify other recording parameters, including the number of channels, sample 
rate (in Hertz), and sample size (in bits). The most common sample rates are 
included in the drop-down menu for convenience, but you can type any other 
non-zero value provided your audio hardware supports it. If you get a 
DirectSound "invalid parameter" error after changing one of these parameters, 
most likely your audio hardware doesn't support recording in the selected audio 
format. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana" >Press "<EM>Start</EM>" to begin recording. Press 
"<EM>Stop</EM>" to stop recording and open the resulting file in Signal Studio. 
Press "<EM>Pause</EM>" at any time to pause the recording, and "<EM>Resume</EM>" 
to resume it. To prevent accidental data loss, both "<EM>Stop</EM>" and 
"<EM>Pause</EM>" display a confirmation dialog. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana" >Audio is captured from the currently selected </FONT><A 
href="ALG.12.015.htm#record device" ><FONT size=2 face="Verdana" >record 
device</FONT></A><FONT face="Verdana" >. The meters on 
the right side of the dialog are continuously updated, and show the current and 
peak audio levels being received from the record device. Note that the Record 
dialog is resizable. If you're recording surround audio, you may want to enlarge 
the Record dialog, so you can see all of the meters at once. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana" >If the audio source is active, but the record level 
meters don't show anything, check your connections. If there's a mixer dialog 
associated with your audio hardware, verify that the correct input is selected, 
and that its level is set appropriately. You may also want to check the OS audio 
settings, typically found in "Settings -&gt; Sounds -&gt; Audio". </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana" >It's possible 
to record while playing along to an existing file, though some latency may 
occur. If you want the existing file to automatically start playing when you 
start recording, check the "<EM>Sync playback</EM>         
              
          " 
option in the Record dialog. If you want the recorded audio to be automatically

<P>  <FONT face=Verdana>Because&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;records directly to disk, 
the recording duration is only limited by available disk space. <STRONG>The 
recording size can exceed 4GB, and if it does, the output file is automatically 
converted from WAV format to RF64 format, in order to avoid WAV format's 4GB 
limit.</STRONG> <STRONG>The file 
extension remains .wav in this case, but&nbsp;Signal Studio 
opens the file correctly regardless of the extension. Note 
however that it's possible to create a recording that&nbsp;Signal Studio

<P><FONT face="Verdana" >It's 
recommended to record to a very fast disk, and to avoid using other applications
