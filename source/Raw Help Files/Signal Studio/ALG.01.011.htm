<FONT face="Verdana" ><STRONG > 1. I cannot open Signal 
Studio.</STRONG></FONT></p><p class=chapter_titles >
<FONT face="Verdana" >
Make sure you have proper access to the Signal Studio 
Directory. Restart your computer and try again. If problem persists, disable 
your anti-virus software and try again. If nothiing works, Reinstall the 
program, you'll lose your configuration unless you backup the "Signal Studio.ini" 
file in the installation directory.

I am getting an error similar 
to: "Encountered a sharing violation while accessing

Make sure you have proper access to the file. Close ALL 
the programs that are using that file. Make sure no programs are 
using that file. Eg: Media Player.

3. When I play an audio, I don't hear 
anything.
</STRONG>
</FONT>
</P>
<P ><FONT face=Verdana>Make sure you 
have the latest sound drivers installed for your sound card. Check for 
any 'loose connections' in the cables to your speakers. Make sure both&nbsp;the 
system's volume and the program's volume are not set to low or muted. If all 
other programs can play sounds, open a support topic. </FONT>

4. I am getting a missing 
library error when trying to Export/Save/Save&nbsp;as a file to .mp3 format or 
any other 
format.</STRONG> 
</FONT> 

   
</P>
<p class=chapter_titles> <FONT face=Verdana>If the format you are trying to export is .mp3 and this is your 
first time, you'll get an error. This is normal. This is because the file that 
is required to encode to mp3 is not included within the program due to legal 
constraints. You can&nbsp;</FONT>

<p class=chapter_titles> <FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>5. My converted file doesn't 
play with XYZ program.</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles><FONT face="Verdana" >Please note that not all format conversions generate files 
that are playable. For example, not all .wav files play with a player that plays 
.wav files. This is why "<EM>Export"</EM> Option<EM> </EM>is included. It has many configurable options. Note 
that different files with the same extension (for example .wav) have different 
subtypes and hence exporting in a different subtype may result in the file not 
plaing with your player. But however, Signal Studio should play it, provided you 
don't have any problems with your audio device. </FONT></p>
<p class=chapter_titles> <FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>6. I cannot open a file in 
Signal Studio.</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles><FONT face="Verdana" >Signal Studio doesn't support ALL the types of audio files, but most;&nbsp;and some video 
files. Also, it doesn't support RAW signal files or signal files encoded by other 
programs. </FONT></p>
<p class=chapter_titles> <FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>7. My Plugin is not 
recognzied.</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles><FONT face="Verdana" >Make sure there is a "plugins" folder in the installation directory. 
Do not rename the folder. It would have been created at the time of installation. 
Make sure that its not accidently renamed or deleted. If its deleted, 
Reinstall the program (you'll lose your configuration; can be set again). 
Make sure you have the compatible plugin (32-bit) installed. Signal Studio 
supports equalization, limiting, compression, and other audio 
effects, via </FONT><A href="http://www.ladspa.org/"><FONT size=2 face="Verdana" >LADSPA</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana> plugins only, not others. 
</FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>8. I&nbsp;am getting an error 
when trying to&nbsp;use a plugin.</STRONG>&nbsp; </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles><FONT face=Verdana>Plugins are external programs that are not written by me. I 
have only made my program compatible to work with them. Contact the developer of 
the plugin. </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>9. I am getting 
a missing file error on opening Signal Studio, even though I have opened it 
without any errors in the past.</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana> This may be due to a virus that deleted or modified the Signal Studio's Components. 
But don't panic, this can also be caused by an Antivirus that wrongly 
blocks access or deletes files thinking&nbsp;Signal Studio's Components as Virus. 
Reinstall the program and try again. If you 
still get an error, contact support. </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>10. I am importing a 
multi-channel [eg: stereo, or higher channel]&nbsp;audio file, but Signal 
Studio only shows a single channel [Mono]. Why?</STRONG> 
</FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana>This happens when you try to open an incomplete file, eg: 
partially downloaded files, corrupt files etc. Make sure that the file you try 
to open is not damaged. If it is, try to obtain another copy of the file and try 
again. Although Signal Studio displays and plays all the channels, in some rare cases, you may 
experience this type of error. No matter even if download the file fully, 
if the file from the source itself is corrupt then this type of error might 
occur. </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>11. The Program 
settings are not saved on exit.</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana>This 
issue can happen on 
Windows 7 and higher&nbsp;systems. Launch the program as administrator [Right click 
<STRONG>Signal Studio</STRONG> -&gt; choose "<STRONG>Run as 
administrator</STRONG>"]. Due 
to the security policy of Windows, Programs are not allowed to write data in 
Program Folders. 
</FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>12. How do I 
reinstall the program?</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana>Launch the setup file that you used to install. If you already have 
an installation of&nbsp;the program and haven't uninstalled, launch setup and 
choose "repair" option from the&nbsp;options displayed. If you currently do not 
have an installation of Signal Studio, launch setup and follow the instructions.

<h3 class=chapter_titles align=center><FONT face=Verdana>FAQ </FONT> </h3>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left> <FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>1. How do I open an audio&nbsp;in the editor?</STRONG> </FONT>   </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana>Select "File -&gt; Open" and browse to your audio file. If its 
not shown in the browse dialog, then the audio is probably not supported. 
However almost all audio files are supported ( including mp2,mp3,mp4,m4a,wav,ogg 
etc.) </FONT>    
                
             
   </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>2. How do I 
convert a file from one format to another?</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana> Open that file in the Signal Studio. 
Select " 
</FONT>        <A href="ALG.03.002.htm" ><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Save As</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana>" Option or " </FONT>   <A href="ALG.03.006.htm" ><FONT size=2 face=Verdana>Export</FONT></A><FONT face=Verdana>" 
Option&nbsp;accordingly.  </FONT> 
</p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face="Verdana" >If you have already downloaded and installed, select the 
portion of the song or select all (<EM>Ctrl + A 
</EM>Keyboard Shortcut) and select </FONT></p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>3. How&nbsp;do I perform 
Karaoke / How&nbsp;do I&nbsp;remove the vocals from a song / How do I use a 
plugin?</STRONG> </FONT>  </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana> Please note that it is done by 
additional plugins which is now included with the Signal Studio package. Select 
   
        the portion of 
the song or select all (<EM>Ctrl + A </EM>Keyboard 
Shortcut) and select the plugin from "Plugin" menu and choose "Karaoke" ( or any 
other plugin that you want to use ). </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana>   Slide the slider to appropriate level as 
required&nbsp;and press OK. </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana>        
    karaoke doesn't always produce the expected results and this is 
not the program's fault, Signal Studio does Karaoke by removing the center panned 
audio. </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana> If the more closer the&nbsp;vocals lie panned in the center, the better is the 
result. As it differs for each song, only a try on the file can tell if it 
can truly remove the vocals or not. The program works by removing the center panned audio, 
which is mostly the vocals. It cannot differentiate between a human singing 
and music. As a result, often beats, along with the vocals, are removed. </FONT> </p>
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face=Verdana> If you are unable to see the "karaoke" plugin in the 
plugin menu after loading the song, it seems your installation of additional plugins 
is unsupported. Please note that Signal Studio accepts only 32-bit 
plugins. 
</FONT> </p><FONT face=Verdana><STRONG>4. How&nbsp;do I perform cut / copy / paste 
operation?</STRONG> </FONT>  
<p class=chapter_titles align=left><FONT face="Verdana" >First, make your selection that&nbsp;you want to cut / 
copy&nbsp;&nbsp;on the window of the audio using mouse or keyboard and copy (<EM>Ctrl+C</EM>) or cut (Ctrl+X). Next move the audio cursor to 
the desired position (you can&nbsp;zoom in for better look)&nbsp;on the same or 
on the other document without restarting Signal Studio. Now paste your selection 
by pressing <EM>Ctrl+V. </EM>Your selection appears. 
<STRONG>Note that the source and the target documents 
should have the same&nbsp;sample rate, otherwise a change in pitch and/or tempo 
will occur on playback and the file will play differently.</STRONG> </FONT></p>
