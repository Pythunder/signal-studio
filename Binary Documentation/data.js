Unlike&nbsp;other apps,&nbsp;Signal Studio is                          perfect , meaning samples aren\'t altered unless they need to be. Editing a portion of a&nbsp;signal/sound file only affects that portion; the rest of the file is untouched. Blocks of audio can be cut and pasted without changing their contents at all. This is especially useful for patching a finished master without corrupting its dither. Make sure to run the program as Administrator on&nbsp;systems that doesn\'t save the program\'s settings on relaunch.                                                                    \n\r\n\rTo get started, Open an Audio File (MP3/Wav/or any supported file) and perform various actions. You can also select a section to apply the effects or to perform actions only to that selection. This applies to cut/copy too. You can also perform additional effects/operations from the Plugins menu.                                                                    \n\r\n\rTo Generate a new Signal, use the Generate... option from the Audio Menu from the Menu Bar.                                                                    \n\r\n\r&nbsp;                                                       \n\r\n\r With Signal Studio, you can:                                                       \n\r  Play almost all   audio files.

If your question/problem is not listed, please contact support at: support@apps.akshay.in.eu.org                   .   TROUBLESHOOTING     \n\r\n\r 1. I cannot open Signal Studio.\n\r\n\rMake sure you have proper access to the Signal Studio Directory. Restart your computer and try again. If problem persists, disable your anti-virus software and try again. If nothiing works, Reinstall the program, you\'ll lose your configuration unless you backup the \"Signal Studio.ini\" file in the installation directory. \n\r\n\r2. I am getting an error similar to: \"Encountered a sharing violation while accessing &lt;filename&gt;\"\n\r\n\rMake sure you have proper access to the file. Close ALL the programs that are using that file. Make sure no programs are using that file. Eg: Media Player. 																		\n\r\n\r3. When I play an audio, I don\'t hear anything.\n\r\n\rMake sure you have the latest sound drivers installed for your sound card. Check for any \'loose connections\' in the cables to your speakers. Make sure both&nbsp;the system\'s volume and the program\'s volume are not set to low or muted. If all other programs can play sounds, open a support topic.    \n\r\n\r  4. I am getting a missing library error when trying to Export/Save/Save&nbsp;as a file to .mp3 format or any other format.     \n\r\n\r If the format you are trying to export is .mp3 and this is your first time, you\'ll get an error. This is normal. This is because the file that is required to encode to mp3 is not included within the program due to legal constraints. You can&nbsp;                                              download the missing library from the       Signal Studio Website                                                                        . For more details,                    see here  \n\r\n\r      If you are getting an error when trying to export to any format, kindly contact support. \n\r\n\r 5. My converted file doesn\'t play with XYZ program.   \n\r\n\rPlease note that not all format conversions generate files that are playable. For example, not all .wav files play with a player that plays .wav files. This is why \"Export\" Option is included. It has many configurable options. Note that different files with the same extension (for example .wav) have different subtypes and hence exporting in a different subtype may result in the file not plaing with your player. But however, Signal Studio should play it, provided you don\'t have any problems with your audio device. \n\r\n\r 6. I cannot open a file in Signal Studio.   \n\r\n\rSignal Studio doesn\'t support ALL the types of audio files, but most;&nbsp;and some video files. Also, it doesn\'t support RAW signal files or signal files encoded by other programs. \n\r\n\r 7. My Plugin is not recognzied.   \n\r\n\rMake sure there is a \"plugins\" folder in the installation directory. Do not rename the folder. It would have been created at the time of installation. Make sure that its not accidently renamed or deleted. If its deleted, Reinstall the program (you\'ll lose your configuration; can be set again). Make sure you have the compatible plugin (32-bit) installed. Signal Studio supports equalization, limiting, compression, and other audio effects, via LADSPA plugins only, not others.  \n\r\n\r8. I&nbsp;am getting an error when trying to&nbsp;use a plugin.&nbsp;   \n\r\n\rPlugins are external programs that are not written by me. I have only made my program compatible to work with them. Contact the developer of the plugin.  \n\r\n\r9. I am getting a missing file error on opening Signal Studio, even though I have opened it without any errors in the past.   \n\r\n\r This may be due to a virus that deleted or modified the Signal Studio\'s Components. But don\'t panic, this can also be caused by an Antivirus that wrongly blocks access or deletes files thinking&nbsp;Signal Studio\'s Components as Virus. Reinstall the program and try again. If you still get an error, contact support.  \n\r\n\r10. I am importing a multi-channel [eg: stereo, or higher channel]&nbsp;audio file, but Signal Studio only shows a single channel [Mono]. Why?   \n\r\n\rThis happens when you try to open an incomplete file, eg: partially downloaded files, corrupt files etc. Make sure that the file you try to open is not damaged. If it is, try to obtain another copy of the file and try again. Although Signal Studio displays and plays all the channels, in some rare cases, you may experience this type of error. No matter even if download the file fully, if the file from the source itself is corrupt then this type of error might occur.  \n\r\n\r11. The Program settings are not saved on exit.   \n\r\n\rThis issue can happen on Windows 7 and higher&nbsp;systems. Launch the program as administrator [Right click Signal Studio -&gt; choose \"Run as administrator\"]. Due to the security policy of Windows, Programs are not allowed to write data in Program Folders.  \n\r\n\r12. How do I reinstall the program?   \n\r\n\rLaunch the setup file that you used to install. If you already have an installation of&nbsp;the program and haven\'t uninstalled, launch setup and choose \"repair\" option from the&nbsp;options displayed. If you currently do not have an installation of Signal Studio, launch setup and follow the instructions.                                               FAQ  \n\r\n\r 1. How do I open an audio&nbsp;in the editor?    \n\r\n\rSelect \"File -&gt; Open\" and browse to your audio file. If its not shown in the browse dialog, then the audio is probably not supported. However almost all audio files are supported ( including mp2,mp3,mp4,m4a,wav,ogg etc.)                                     \n\r\n\r2. How do I convert a file from one format to another?   \n\r\n\r Open that file in the Signal Studio. Select \"         Save As\" Option or \"    Export\" Option&nbsp;accordingly.   \n\r\n\rIf you have already downloaded and installed, select the portion of the song or select all (Ctrl + A Keyboard Shortcut) and select \n\r\n\r3. How&nbsp;do I perform Karaoke / How&nbsp;do I&nbsp;remove the vocals from a song / How do I use a plugin?   \n\r\n\r Please note that it is done by additional plugins which is now included with the Signal Studio package. Select            the portion of the song or select all (Ctrl + A Keyboard Shortcut) and select the plugin from \"Plugin\" menu and choose \"Karaoke\" ( or any other plugin that you want to use ).  \n\r\n\r   Slide the slider to appropriate level as required&nbsp;and press OK.  \n\r\n\r            karaoke doesn\'t always produce the expected results and this is not the program\'s fault, Signal Studio does Karaoke by removing the center panned audio.  \n\r\n\r If the more closer the&nbsp;vocals lie panned in the center, the better is the result. As it differs for each song, only a try on the file can tell if it can truly remove the vocals or not. The program works by removing the center panned audio, which is mostly the vocals. It cannot differentiate between a human singing and music. As a result, often beats, along with the vocals, are removed.  \n\r\n\r If you are unable to see the \"karaoke\" plugin in the plugin menu after loading the song, it seems your installation of additional plugins is unsupported. Please note that Signal Studio accepts only 32-bit plugins.  4. How&nbsp;do I perform cut / copy / paste operation?   \n\r\n\rFirst, make your selection that&nbsp;you want to cut / copy&nbsp;&nbsp;on the window of the audio using mouse or keyboard and copy (Ctrl+C) or cut (Ctrl+X). Next move the audio cursor to the desired position (you can&nbsp;zoom in for better look)&nbsp;on the same or on the other document without restarting Signal Studio. Now paste your selection by pressing Ctrl+V. Your selection appears. Note that the source and the target documents should have the same&nbsp;sample rate, otherwise a change in pitch and/or tempo will occur on playback and the file will play differently. \n\r\n\r 5.

Signal Studio displays the Save As dialog box so you can name your document, and/or specify its file format via the \"Save as type\" drop-down list. To save a document with its existing name and directory, use the Save      command instead. \n\r\n\r  This command is different from the        Export Option   .&nbsp;         \n\r\n\r   For many file formats, the Export command gives more precise control over the format details, letting you save the document with a different bit depth  , or in a floating-point or compressed subtype. Some compressed formats display a configuration dialog that lets you specify encoding parameters.\n\r\n\r&nbsp;\n\r\n\r&nbsp;","Save As","scr\\ALG.03.002.htm","&nbsp; 																		 File Info       Option             \n\r\n\r This command displays information about the active document, including its duration, audio             format, and size.    \n\r\n\r &nbsp;","File Info","scr\\ALG.03.005.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Export       Option           \n\r\n\rThis command lets you save audio in other file formats. Unlike the File -&gt; Save As command, File -&gt; Export gives you precise control over the format details, via the Export dialog. The Export dialog contains three drop lists, which let you specify the major format, subtype, and endianness. The list of subtypes varies depending on which major format is selected, and on the number of channels in the audio. Note that some combinations of major format and channel count have few or no subtypes. \n\r\n\rYou can also use File -&gt; Save As to save audio in other formats, by selecting the desired format in the file dialog\'s \"Save as type\" drop list. In this case&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;tries to find an integer PCM subtype with the correct sample size, so that no precision is lost. If no suitable subtype is available, the save fails with the message \"Format not recognized.\" \n\r\n\r   The Export command is more powerful than Save As, but also more dangerous: it lets you save audio in any supported combination of format and subtype, regardless of whether precision is lost. Note that if you reduce the sample size, or select a floating point or compressed subtype, the resulting file will not be a                                                        perfect  copy of the audio .      \n\r\n\r ","Export","scr\\ALG.03.006.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Exit     Option             \n\r\n\rUse this command to end your&nbsp;Signal Studio session.

","Fit verically","scr\\ALG.04.001.htm","&nbsp; 																		      \n\r\n\rClipboard \n\r\n\rThe clipboard is the destination for cut and copy, and the source for paste.&nbsp;Signal Studio has a private clipboard, which differs from the Windows clipboard. Signal Studio\'s clipboard is only accessible to the current instance of Signal Studio, and can\'t be used to share audio with other applications.              \n\r\n\rIt\'s also non-persistent, meaning its contents disappear when&nbsp;Signal Studio exits.

Undo is unlimited    by default, but it can also be limited to a specific number of levels                                 . \n\r\n\r Each document has its own list of previous states, or undo history, and these histories can become large, particularly when big files are edited. Consequently undo states are stored on disk by default, though they can alternatively be stored in memory to improve performance; see disk threshold          . \n\r\n\r The undo history can be viewed and traversed via the history bar.\n\r\n\r&nbsp;","Undo / Redo","scr\\ALG.08.003.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Record       Option          \n\r\n\rThis command records audio to a file. To start a recording, use \"Transport -&gt; Record\", or press \"Ctrl+R\" (Keyboard Shortcut). Alternatively you can use the Toolbar\'s record button. \n\r\n\r  First the \"Save Recording As\" file dialog is displayed, prompting you to choose a file name and folder for the recording. Don\'t enter a file extension, as only .wav is supported. Press \"OK\" to continue. \n\r\n\rNext the Record dialog is displayed, prompting you to specify other recording parameters, including the number of channels, sample rate (in Hertz), and sample size (in bits). The most common sample rates are included in the drop-down menu for convenience, but you can type any other non-zero value provided your audio hardware supports it. If you get a DirectSound \"invalid parameter\" error after changing one of these parameters, most likely your audio hardware doesn\'t support recording in the selected audio format. \n\r\n\rPress \"Start\" to begin recording. Press \"Stop\" to stop recording and open the resulting file in Signal Studio. Press \"Pause\" at any time to pause the recording, and \"Resume\" to resume it. To prevent accidental data loss, both \"Stop\" and \"Pause\" display a confirmation dialog. \n\r\n\rAudio is captured from the currently selected record device. The meters on the right side of the dialog are continuously updated, and show the current and peak audio levels being received from the record device. Note that the Record dialog is resizable. If you\'re recording surround audio, you may want to enlarge the Record dialog, so you can see all of the meters at once. \n\r\n\rIf the audio source is active, but the record level meters don\'t show anything, check your connections. If there\'s a mixer dialog associated with your audio hardware, verify that the correct input is selected, and that its level is set appropriately. You may also want to check the OS audio settings, typically found in \"Settings -&gt; Sounds -&gt; Audio\". \n\r\n\rIt\'s possible to record while playing along to an existing file, though some latency may occur. If you want the existing file to automatically start playing when you start recording, check the \"Sync playback                                 \" option in the Record dialog. If you want the recorded audio to be automatically opened after recording stops, check the \"Open recording       \" option. \n\r\n\r  Because&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;records directly to disk, the recording duration is only limited by available disk space. The recording size can exceed 4GB, and if it does, the output file is automatically converted from WAV format to RF64 format, in order to avoid WAV format\'s 4GB limit. The file extension remains .wav in this case, but&nbsp;Signal Studio opens the file correctly regardless of the extension. Note however that it\'s possible to create a recording that&nbsp;Signal Studio can\'t open because it won\'t fit in                                                                                   memory . This is likely to occur with&nbsp;any 32-bit program.              \n\r\n\rIt\'s recommended to record to a very fast disk, and to avoid using other applications while recording. For laptops, recording to an external drive may be preferable. If the disk can\'t keep up, the recording is aborted                                    ; see also record buffer size.\n\r\n\r","Record","scr\\ALG.08.004.htm","&nbsp; 																		Insert Command              \n\r\n\rThis command inserts one or more audio files at the audio cursor position.

To insert non-empty channels, or delete specific channels, use Insert Channel or Delete Channel  respectively. Note that the audio is NOT resampled, hence changing the sample rate causes the audio to play at a different pitch. To avoid this, use the resample  command instead.

If a selection exists, only the selection is searched, otherwise the entire document is searched. If any instances of clipping are found, they\'re reported in the results bar. Selecting an instance in the results bar moves the audio cursor to the start of the instance. This makes it easy to zoom into the instance and determine if it\'s problematic or not. \n\r\n\rThe command displays a dialog that lets you customize the search, by adjusting the start and stop thresholds, and the clipping level. Both thresholds are sample counts, defined in terms of the maximal sample (see below). The start threshold is the number of maximal samples in a row required to start a clipping instance. The end threshold is the number of non-maximal samples in a row required to end a clipping instance. Note that the existence of maximal samples doesn\'t necessarily imply that clipping occurred. \n\r\n\rThe clipping level is the level a sample must reach to be considered maximal, expressed in decibels. The default setting of zero means only samples \"on the rails\" (i.e. having the largest positive or negative value permitted by the audio format) are considered maximal. Reducing the clipping level lets you search for peaks instead of clips. For example, to find peaks that reach -3 dB, set clipping level to -3.

Signal Studio handles these two types of plugins differently with respect to channel selection. \n\r\n\rFor mono plugins, the plugin is simply applied to the selected channels, one at a time. Since all channels are selected by default, explicit channel selection is only necessary if you want to process channels differently. For example to EQ a stereo file\'s channels differently, two operations are required: first select the left channel only and apply the EQ, and then select the right channel only, and apply the EQ again, specifying different parameters. \n\r\n\rFor non-mono plugins, the number of selected channels must match the maximum of the plugin\'s input and output counts. In other words, whichever is bigger, the number of inputs or the number of outputs, is how many channels must be selected for a non-mono plugin. \n\r\n\rFor example, the stereo compressor plugin SC4 has two inputs and two outputs. This means stereo audio works \"naturally\" with SC4, in the sense that channel selection isn\'t necessary. Mono audio won\'t work however: the mono compressor (SC4 mono) must be used instead. SC4 can also handle surround audio, but in this case, channel selection is necessary: you must select two channels, otherwise you\'ll get the error message \"Plugin SC4 requires 2 selected channels.\" Given a 5.1 surround file, you could select the Front Left and Front Right for example, or any other pair of channels. The selected channels needn\'t be adjacent. \n\r\n\rSome plugins have asymmetric I/O configurations, i.e. more inputs than outputs or vice versa, and in such cases the following rules apply: \n\r\n\r        More inputs than outputs    The plugin reads and writes the first N selected       channels, where N is the output count; the remaining selected       channels are only read, and remain unmodified.      More outputs than inputs    The plugin reads and writes the first N selected       channels, where N is the input count; the remaining selected       channels are only written, and their current contents are     ignored.\n\r\n\rThe following examples further illustrate asymmetric I/O behavior: \n\r\n\r        Plugin    Inputs    Outputs    Behavior      SC2    2    1    Two channels must be selected. Both channels are       used as input. The output overwrites the first channel, while the second       channel remains unmodified. You may want to delete the second       channel afterwards, by right-clicking it and selecting \"Delete       Channel\".      GVerb    1    2    Two channels must be selected. Of the two       selected channels, only the first one is used as input; the plugin ignores       the contents of the second channel, which can be empty. If your file is       mono, simply add an extra empty channel to the file, by using the       Format command to       change the channel count from 1 to 2. Both channels are overwritten by the       output.","Plugins and Channels","scr\\ALG.08.030.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Getting More       Plugins                \n\r\n\rStarting with Signal Studio version 1.1, the set of 92 plugins are now pre-included within the package itself.&nbsp;To get more plugins , you   may access the internet to find some. Be careful to download the appropriate one:&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;only accepts 32-bit versions of those plugins. In theory&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;can use any LADSPA plugins, not just Steve\'s, but Windows LADSPA plugins are rare, and 64-bit versions even more so. \n\r\n\rAdditional plugins must be copied into the \"Plugins\"        folder, which is normally a subfolder of the folder containing Signal Studio.exe. A typical path is either \"C:\\Program Files\\Signal Studio\\Plugins\"&nbsp;on 32-bit systems, or \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Signal Studio\\Plugins\"&nbsp;on 64-bit systems.                              \n\r\n\rSignal Studio&nbsp;determines what plugins are available during startup only. Consequently, if plugins are added to the Plugins folder while&nbsp;Signal Studio is running, they won\'t be available until&nbsp;Signal Studio is exited and restarted. \n\r\n\rAvoid deleting plugins from the \"Plugins\" folder while Signal Studio is running, as this may cause errors. If&nbsp;Signal Studio can\'t find at least one valid plugin during startup,                                                    the Plugin menu is hidden   . A missing Plugin menu may also be symptomatic of having downloaded the wrong distribution, i.e. attempting to use 64-bit plugins in 32-bit&nbsp;Signal Studio or vice versa. \n\r\n\rNote that four of Steve\'s plugins depend on an additional library, libfftw3f-3.dll, which is included in the plugins distribution. To use any of these four plugins, libfftw3f-3.dll must also be copied into the Plugins folder, otherwise they will fail to load. The four FFTW-dependent plugins are: \n\r  Impulse convolver (imp_1199.dll)   Multiband EQ (mbeq_1197.dll)   Pitch Scaler (pitch_scale_1193.dll)   Higher Quality Pitch Scaler (pitch_scale_1194.dll)   \n\r\n\r\n\rSteve provides documentation                 for his plugins and their parameters. \n\r\n\r","Getting More Plugins","scr\\ALG.08.031.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Paste     Command          \n\r\n\rThis command inserts the contents of the clipboard at the audio cursor position.

The plugins included in the&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;download are Windows ports of             Steve Harris\' LADSPA plugins, and include filters (DJ EQ, triple parametric EQ, high pass, low pass, band pass), a limiter, and mono and stereo compressors. The entire set of 92 plugins is available within the Signal Studio itself, starting from version 1.1; see                                            Getting more plugins.  \n\r\n\rTo use a plugin, select it from the Plugin menu. You may want to select a portion of the audio first, otherwise the plugin will be applied to the audio\'s entire duration. For multi-channel audio, you may also want to select which channel(s) the plugin should operate on.                  Channel selection is straightforward for mono plugins, but more complicated for other types of plugins; see                Plugins and channels.  \n\r\n\rSelecting a plugin causes&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;to display the Plugin Parameters dialog, which lets you change the plugin\'s parameters. To change a parameter, either adjust its slider control, or type a new value in its edit control and press Tab or Shift+Tab. The range shown for each parameter is only a hint; values outside the suggested range can be specified via the edit control. Plugin parameter changes are remembered during any given run of Signal Studio. To reset the plugin\'s parameters to their default state, press the Parameters dialog\'s Reset button. Once the plugin\'s parameters are set as desired, press OK to close the dialog and apply the plugin to the selected audio.                                                                         \n\r\n\rTo preview a plugin, do as follows: Select a small portion of audio, and               play it with    looping enabled, so that it repeats. Now select the plugin from the Plugin menu, adjust its parameters as desired, and press OK to apply the plugin. If the result is unsatisfactory,                                undo (Ctrl+Z), and press \" Ctrl+L\" to repeat the last plugin. Now readjust the parameters and press \" OK \" again. Repeat this process of undoing, repeating, readjusting, and reapplying until the desired result is obtained.

Signal Studio was formerly known as \"Signal Studio\". Signal Studio includes components from several Open-Sourced Projects. Notably, Signal Studio was developed from Chris Korda\'s work. All the brand names, Product Names and Trademarks belong to their respective owners. Signal Studio is licensed under the version 2 or higher&nbsp;GNU GPL License.Performance\n\r\n\rSignal Studio&nbsp;is unusually fast, because unlike many audio editors, it stores the entire document in memory, and performs all editing in memory. This speed comes at the cost of increased demand for memory.             \n\r\n\rMany audio editors were designed around the limitations of 32-bit Windows, and consequently store audio primarily on disk, swapping it in and out of memory in small chunks as needed. This bottleneck increases complexity and reduces performance, needlessly given current technology. \n\r\n\rBy default, the clipboard and undo history are stored on disk, however you can opt to store them partially or entirely in memory in order to increase performance; see disk threshold for details. Note that this increases the risk of running out memory. \n\r\n\rUsers of 32-bit Windows should avoid running other apps simultaneously with Signal Studio, and may want to try adding the /3GB startup switch to their Startup Options (boot.ini). This switch squeezes the OS into 1GB, thereby potentially making as much as 3GB available to applications, though your mileage may vary. Perfect\n\r\n\rThe philosophy of perfect editing can be summarized as \"don\'t touch the bits unless you have to.\" More formally, a bit-perfect editor passes the round-trip test, which is: open a document, and without changing anything, save it as a different name, and then use a binary comparison tool to verify that the copy is identical to the original.&nbsp;Signal Studio passes the round-trip test, and care has been taken to ensure that edits are as non-destructive as possible, meaning that if a subset of an audio file is edited, the remainder is untouched. This makes&nbsp;Signal Studio ideal for patching finished masters and similar work. \n\r\n\rThe following editing commands either don\'t alter the samples, or do so in a way that\'s entirely reversible: \n\r  Clipboard commands   Reverse   Invert   Format (depending on the   operation)\n\rMP3 encoding  \n\r\n\r To save the current document as MP3, use \"File -&gt; Save As\", change the Save As dialog\'s \"Save as type\" to MP3, and press the Save button. Note however that the first time you do this,&nbsp;Signal Studio will likely display the Missing Library dialog, containing this message: \"A library is missing, and must be located on your computer, or downloaded and then located.\" This occurs because the MP3 encoder (LAME) is NOT included in the&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;download. \n\r\n\rThe needed library is libmp3lame.dll. If you already have it, and know where it is, use the Browse button to locate it. An Open file dialog is displayed. Navigate to the appropriate folder, select the DLL, and press the Open button. If the DLL is acceptable, the MP3 Encoder Configuration dialog appears. \n\r\n\rIf you think you have the DLL but don\'t know where it is, use the Search button to search your hard drives for it. Use this option only if&nbsp;you are sure that you have the file.&nbsp;This might take a&nbsp;huge amount of time, depending on how many drives you have and how full they are. If the DLL is found, you\'ll get a confirmation prompt; press Yes to proceed. Again, if the DLL is acceptable, the MP3 Encoder Configuration dialog appears. \n\r\n\rIf you don\'t have the DLL, press the Download button, which launches your web browser and directs it to Signal Studio\'s Website                      , where the DLL is available. The minimum acceptable version is 3.99.5. Note that the LAME DLL shows a slightly different version number in Windows (via Explorer, right-click, Properties, Version tab), with four levels instead of three, as in 3.99.2.5.&nbsp; Also you want the \"standard\" version, not the \"INI File Setup\" version. Download the package, unzip it, and move the DLL somewhere sensible (see below). Then locate it from Signal Studio, using the Missing Library dialog\'s Browse or Search, as described above. \n\r\n\rThe recommended location for the LAME DLL is to put the DLL in the same folder as Signal Studio.exe (that\'s the folder that you have installed Signal Studio). \n\r\n\r        MP3       Encoder Configuration dialog              Algorithm    This option sets LAME\'s internal       algorithm quality. Unless you\'re very impatient, always use High Quality.       Speed kills.      Bit Rate Mode    This option selects one of three       methods for limiting the bit rate and size of the output file.      Constant Bit Rate    CBR encodes every frame at the specified target       bit rate. CBR is the least efficient mode, and is only recommended in       streaming situations where the upper bit rate must be strictly       enforced.      Average Bit Rate    ABR maintains the specified target bit rate on       average, but uses more bits for complex passages and less bits for simple       ones, thereby achieving better quality than CBR for the same file       size.      Variable Bit Rate    VBR encoding varies the bit rate similarly to       ABR, but targets a specified quality level, instead of a bit rate. The       output file size is less predictable than with ABR, but the quality is       usually better.      Bit Rate    The target bit rate, in kbps; used in       CBR and ABR modes.      Quality    The target quality level; only used in       VBR mode.File formats  \n\r\n\r        &nbsp;    AAC (MP4 Audio)    AIFF (Apple/SGI)    AU (Sun/NeXT)    AVR (Audio Visual Research)    CAF (Apple Core Audio File)    FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)    HTK (HMM Tool Kit)    IFF (Amiga IFF/SVX8/SV16)    MAT4 (GNU Octave 2.0 / Matlab 4.2)    MAT5 (GNU Octave 2.1 / Matlab 5.0)    MPC (Akai MPC 2k)    MP3 (MPEG Audio)    OGG (OGG Container format)    PAF (Ensoniq PARIS)    PVF (Portable Voice Format)    RAW (header-less)    RF64 (RIFF 64)    SD2 (Sound Designer II)    SDS (Midi Sample Dump Standard)    SF (Berkeley/IRCAM/CARL)    VOC (Creative Labs)    W64 (SoundFoundry WAVE 64)    WAV (Microsoft)    WAV (NIST Sphere)    WAVEX (Microsoft)    WVE (Psion Series 3)    XI (FastTracker 2)      Signed 8 bit PCM    &nbsp;

","Reverse","scr\\ALG.11.010.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Spectrum       Option          \n\r\n\rThis command analyzes the frequency spectrum of audio, via a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The result is displayed as a plot in which the horizontal axis is frequency in Hertz, and the vertical axis is amplitude in decibels. The FFT output can also be exported to a tab-delimited text file, using the Export button. For real-time analysis, use the spectrum bar instead. \n\r\n\rIf a selection exists, only the selection is analyzed, otherwise the entire document is analyzed. The analysis has various parameters, described below. After changing one or more parameters, press the Refresh button (Alt-R Keyboard Shortcut) to re-compute the FFT and update the plot. It\'s not necessary to refresh after changing Frequency Axis or View, because they don\'t require re-computing the FFT.\n\r\n\r        Window Function      This selects which window       function to apply to the audio prior to the FFT, to reduce spectral       leakage. All are bell-shaped or triangular, except for the rectangular       window.                                              Window Size      This is the size of the       FFT, in sample frames. Larger values give increased spectral resolution       (more frequency                         bands), which is       helpful when analyzing low frequencies.                    Frequency Axis      This determines whether the       plot\'s frequency axis is has a linear or logarithmic scale. A logarithmic       scale allocates more space (visually) to low frequencies.                                          Channel Mode      This determines how       multi-channel audio is handled.

The tooltip appears when the mouse cursor is positioned on or near a data point (or the line between two data points), and held there for half a second. Once the tooltip is shown, if the cursor is moved along the plotted line, the tooltip tracks the cursor and updates itself immediately. To hide the tooltip, left-click; it stays hidden until it\'s reset by moving the cursor outside the plot window, and then back.  \n\r\n\r","Spectrum","scr\\ALG.11.012.htm","																		 Swap Channels       Option            \n\r\n\rThis command exchanges a pair of channels in a multi-channel audio file.

Activation\n\r\n\rSignal&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;provides various methods for stopping and starting a recording, known as activation types: \n\r\n\r        Type    Summary    Description      Prompt    Fully interactive    The user is prompted for the output file name       and folder, and then prompted for the audio format. Recording begins when       the user presses the Start button in the Record dialog. If the user       attempts to stop the recording, a confirmation prompt is displayed, and       recording continues until the stop is confirmed.      One touch    One-touch recording (OTR)    Recording begins immediately. The filename is       generated automatically; the output folder         and       audio format               are specified via the Record Options. Stopping is       similarly immediate, i.e. stop confirmation is suppressed. This activation       type is optimal for use with scheduled recording   and hot keys.      Sound    Sound-activated recording    Input levels are monitored, and recording only       begins if the start trigger conditions are       met. Recording ends when the stop trigger conditions are met, or when the       Record dialog is closed. Multiple recordings may result. Filenames are       generated automatically; the output folder and audio format are specified       via the Record Options. Stop confirmation is   suppressed.\n\r\n\rFully interactive mode is obvious and foolproof, but potentially cumbersome, whereas OTR sacrifices control and safeguards for immediacy.\n\r\n\rScheduled recording   \n\r\n\rScheduled recording is supported via the Windows Task Scheduler. To schedule a recording, create a Scheduled Task, and specify the /r argument on the&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;command line. This argument causes&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;to execute a record command immediately upon being launched. Note that the activation type still matters in this case: if it\'s \"Prompt\", it\'s automatically changed to \"One touch\", but if it\'s \"Sound\", it\'s left alone, allowing you to schedule a sound-activated recording.Audio format \n\r\n\rThis option lets you specify the audio format for recording. For one-touch and sound-activated recording, this is the only way to specify the format, but if the record activation type is \"Prompt\", the format can also be specified via the Record dialog. The audio format consists of a channel count, a sample rate in Hertz, and a sample size in bits. Note that your record device may only a support a limited set of audio formats.Hot keys \n\r\n\rThis option lets you assign global (system-wide) hot keys (shortcut-like keys)&nbsp;to start and stop recording. Hot keys are intended for use with the \"One-touch\" record activation type. They\'re supported for other activation types, but probably won\'t be as useful. Note that&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;must be running to detect hot keys, though it can be minimized, and needn\'t be the foreground task. \n\r\n\rTo assign a hot key, first use the drop-list to select the target function (\"Start\" or \"Stop\"). Then focus the hot key control (to the right of the drop-list), by either left-clicking it, or pressing Tab. Now enter the desired key combination, and then move the focus elsewhere, by left-clicking a different control, or pressing Tab again. To delete an existing hot key assignment, press Delete or Backspace in the hot key control. \n\r\n\rHot key definitions must include at least one modifier key, i.e. Ctrl, Shift, or Alt. Multiple modifier keys (e.g. Ctrl+Shift) are permitted and strongly encouraged. Unmodified hot keys, and hot keys modified only by Alt are disallowed, to avoid conflicting with menus. Choose your hot keys carefully to avoid overriding Signal Studio\'s shortcuts, and/or the shortcuts of other applications.Output folder \n\r\n\rThis option specifies the output folder for one-touch and sound-activated recording. It\'s only applicable when the record activation type is \"One-touch\" or \"Sound\". In both of these cases, the filename is generated automatically from the current date and time. If the activation type is \"Prompt\", the output folder and filename are specified via the \"Save Recording As\" dialog, so this option doesn\'t apply. \n\r\n\rThe folder path can be browsed for, or entered in the edit control. A relative path is permitted, It\'s relative to the application (i.e. the folder containing Signal Studio.exe).Triggers\n\r\n\rThis option specifies the conditions in which sound-activated recording starts and stops. It\'s only applicable when the record activation type is \"Sound\". Start and stop each have their own condition, consisting of an input level threshold in decibels, and a minimum duration in seconds. Recording begins if the input level (on any channel) reaches or exceeds the start threshold, for at least the start duration. Once started, recording continues until the input level (on all channels) falls below the stop threshold, for at least the stop duration. \n\r\n\rThe start condition defines \"activity\" or \"signal\", while the stop condition defines \"inactivity\" or \"quiet\". The stop duration is especially important because it determines how inconsistent input is handled. If the input contains quiet pauses, and the pauses are longer than the stop duration, the recording may be split into multiple files. To avoid this, increase the stop duration.\n\r\n\r&nbsp;","Record","scr\\ALG.12.006.htm","&nbsp; 																		Audio       Tab         \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\rDue to constant development in design and features, the appearance of certain elements may differ in the program.Playback device\n\r\n\rThis option lets you select a DirectSound device driver for audio playback. The default is Primary Sound Driver, which is usually optimal. Note that if you connect a USB audio device while the options dialog is displayed, it won\'t appear in the driver list until you close and reopen the options dialog. Playback buffer size\n\r\n\rThis option lets you adjust the size of the DirectSound playback buffer, in milliseconds. If the playback buffer is too small, playback may skip, stutter, or be distorted, due to buffer underrun. Increasing the buffer size makes underrun less likely, at the cost of increased latency, e.g. when starting or stopping playback or setting the audio position.Record device \n\r\n\rThis option lets you select a DirectSound device driver for audio recording. The default is Primary Sound Capture Driver, which is usually optimal. Note that if you connect a USB audio device while the options dialog is displayed, it won\'t appear in the driver list until you close and reopen the options dialog.Record buffer size  \n\r\n\rThis option lets you adjust the size of the DirectSound recording buffer, in milliseconds. If the recording buffer is too small, the recording may fail with the error \"Capture buffer overrun.\" This error usually indicates that the disk is unable to keep up with the recording, particularly when recording in a high resolution and/or surround audio format. In this case a larger buffer size may help. Increasing the buffer size causes&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;to write bigger chunks less often, and because disks are optimized for large sequential transfers, this may improve performance, at the cost of increased memory use. \n\r\n\rThe data rate needed for a given audio format is calculated as follows: Channels × (SampleSize / 8) × SampleRate. For CD-quality audio, the data rate is 2 × (16 / 8) × 44,100 = 176,400 bytes per second. Any current drive should be able to handle this data rate easily, unless there\'s excessive competition for the drive from other applications. Note however that more advanced audio formats can be significantly more demanding, e.g. 8 channels of 24-bit at 48KHz requires over 1MB/s.MP3 import\n\r\n\rThis option sets the sample size for imported MP3 audio. The MPEG decoder has exceptional resolution and can output either 16-bit or 24-bit PCM. For the best quality, select 24-bit. Note that the decoder supports MPEG audio layers I, II, and III (AKA MP3).  AAC/MP4 import\n\r\n\rThese options set the sample size and downmix options for imported AAC/MP4 audio. The AAC decoder can output 16-bit, 24-bit or 32-bit PCM. For better quality, select a bigger sample size. The \"Downmix to stereo\" option determines how surround files are handled: if it\'s checked, files with more than two channels are downmixed to stereo, otherwise they\'re imported as surround.  VBR encoding quality\n\r\n\rThis option sets the Variable Bit Rate encoding quality, which is currently only used when writing Ogg Vorbis files. Larger values improve sound quality, at the cost of increased file size. The quality ranges from 0 (worst/smallest) to 100 (best/biggest), and defaults to 40.Meter clip threshold  \n\r\n\rThis option sets the sensitivity of clip detection in level meters, which appear in the meter bar and Record dialog. If a clip is detected on a given audio channel, that channel\'s clip indicator is set; the indication consists of a red rectangle behind the abbreviated channel name, which appears above the level meter. To reset a clip indicator, left-click it. To reset all clip indicators at once, Alt+left-click anywhere within the meter view. \n\r\n\rThe threshold is expressed in samples, and specifies the minimum number of consecutive samples that must be \"on the rails\" to be considered clipping. Note that a clip indication doesn\'t guarantee that peaks were truncated, it just means it\'s likely, particularly if the threshold is large. To disable meter clip detection, set the threshold to a huge number.\n\r\n\r&nbsp;\n\r\n\r","Audio tab","scr\\ALG.12.015.htm","&nbsp; 																		Options        \n\r\n\r This menu provides a lot of options that are discussed here:            Options                                                                      ","Options","scr\\ALG.12.024.htm","&nbsp; 																		Spectrum Tab    \n\r\n\r                             \n\r\n\rDue to constant development in design and features, the appearance of certain elements may differ in the program.                             Window function \n\r\n\rThis option selects which window function the spectrum bar applies to audio, prior to the FFT, to reduce spectral leakage. All functions are bell-shaped or triangular, except for the rectangular window. \n\r\n\r        Bartlett    triangular      Blackman    higher-order generalized cosine      Blackman Harris    higher-order generalized cosine      Hamming    minimizes the nearest side lobe      Hann (AKA Hanning)    classic raised cosine      Rectangular    brick wall      Welch    parabolic sectionWindow size \n\r\n\rThis option selects the window size (in sample frames) of the spectrum bar\'s FFT. The window size determines the number of output frequency bands (AKA bins), and lets you control the inevitable trade-off between responsiveness (smaller windows) and spectral resolution (bigger windows). Bigger window sizes show more spectral detail, particularly for low frequencies, but at the cost of increased latency. See also averaging. \n\r\n\rThe number of output frequency bands equals the window size divided by two, so a window size of 1024 yields 512 output bands. The bands are equally spaced in terms of frequency, meaning they all have the same width, equal to the audio\'s sample rate divided by the window size. For a window size of 1024, and assuming CD audio, the bandwidth is 44,100 / 1024 = 43 Hz. The resulting latency is the reciprocal of the bandwidth, or 1 / 43 = 23 milliseconds in this case. 23 ms is responsive enough, but 43 Hz is poor resolution for bass frequencies. A window size of 4096 gives a bandwidth of 44,100 / 4096 = 10.8 Hz, considerably improving the resolution, but worsening the latency to 1 / 10.8 = 93 ms. Pick your poison. \n\r\n\rNote that large window sizes (8192 or higher) may overload the CPU if a filled plot style is selected, potentially making&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;sluggish or unresponsive. If this occurs, reduce the window size or change the plot style to \"Line\".Averaging\n\r\n\rThis option determines how many windows of audio are analyzed for each plot update in the spectrum bar. If averaging is zero, only one window is analyzed per update and averaging is effectively disabled; this maximizes responsiveness, but at the cost of jerkiness. If averaging is one, two windows (overlapped by 50%) are analyzed per update, resulting in a slightly smoother plot, for a small cost in terms of increased latency. Bigger averaging values make the plot smoother, but less temporally accurate. \n\r\n\rAveraging interacts with window size to determine responsiveness. Even with averaging disabled, smaller window sizes still give better responsiveness (and worse spectral resolution) than larger ones. Note that a large averaging value combined with a large window size can cause excessive CPU overhead, particularly if a filled plot style   is selected.Plot style \n\r\n\rThis option selects the style of plot shown in the spectrum bar. Note that filled styles require much more CPU power than Line style, particularly for large window sizes. \n\r\n\r        Line    Series points are drawn as a   polyline.      Area    Series points are filled as a   polygon.      Outlined Area    Series points are filled as a polygon, and also       drawn as a polyline.Frequency axis\n\r\n\rThis option selects the type of frequency axis (linear or logarithmic) shown in the spectrum bar. A logarithmic scale allocates more space (visually) to low frequencies.  Channel mode\n\r\n\rThis option determines how the spectrum bar handles multi-channel audio. Select \"Combine\" to sum all channels prior to analysis, or \"Separate\" to analyze each channel individually.Plot colors\n\r\n\rThis option lets you customize the colors of the plot background and grid in the spectrum bar. To edit a color, press its corresponding button.Show peaks \n\r\n\rThis option determines whether the      spectrum bar shows peaks, and in what style, as follows:          \n\r\n\r        Off    Don\'t show   peaks.         Lines    Show peaks as     lines.          Dots    Show peaks as     dots.    \n\r\n\rThe \"Lines\" style is more compatible with the \"Area\" and \"Outlined Area\"             plot styles. If the plot style is \"Line\", it\'s recommended to show peaks as dots to avoid confusion. Peak persistence is configurable via the                        peak hold   and   peak decay settings.  Peak hold \n\r\n\rThis option determines the spectrum bar\'s peak hold time, in milliseconds. It\'s only relevant when peaks are being shown, i.e. when Show Peaks isn\'t \"Off\". The bigger the hold time, the longer peaks are held. If the hold time is zero, peaks aren\'t held, and begin decaying immediately. If the hold time is large (e.g. 10,000), peaks rarely or never decay, until the plot is reset. To reset the plot, use the Reset command in the Spectrum bar\'s context menu, or switch to a different document.Peak decay \n\r\n\rThis option determines the     spectrum bar\'s peak decay rate, in decibels per second. It\'s only relevant when peaks are being shown, i.e. when                   Show Peaks isn\'t \"Off\". A peak begins decaying when the          peak hold time expires, and the bigger the decay rate, the more rapidly it decays. If the decay rate is zero, peaks don\'t decay, in which case they accumulate and persist until the plot is reset. To reset the plot, use the Reset command in the Spectrum bar\'s context menu, or switch to a different document.                                                      \n\r\n\r&nbsp;","Spectrum tab","scr\\ALG.12.027.htm","&nbsp; 																		 View   Tab         \n\r\n\r       \n\r\n\rDue to constant development in design and features, the appearance of certain elements may differ in the program.       \n\r\n\r      \n\r\n\r       Zoom step size  \n\r\n\rThis option lets you customize the step sizes for time zoom    (horizontal) and amplitude zoom   (vertical). The step sizes affect zooming via mouse wheel, menus and keyboard shortcuts . They\'re expressed as percentages: a value of 200% means each step changes the magnification by 2x.Show time in sample frames     \n\r\n\rThis option controls how time (position within the audio) is displayed throughout Signal Studio, e.g. on the time ruler and in the navigation bar  . If this option is checked, time is displayed in sample frames, otherwise it\'s displayed in time format  .Vertically sync channels   \n\r\n\rThis option determines whether channels are vertically synchronized, or independent, i.e. whether zooming amplitude   affects all channels at once. When this option is checked, all channels have the same amplitude zoom and the same the origin y-coordinate. To zoom each channel\'s amplitude independently, uncheck this option.Vertical zoom at cursor   \n\r\n\rThis option determines whether zooming amplitude   via mouse wheel (Shift+wheel) considers the mouse cursor position. If this option is checked, amplitude zoom centers on the mouse cursor\'s vertical position, and the origin moves as necessary. If it\'s unchecked, amplitude zoom centers on the origin, which stays fixed, and the mouse cursor position is ignored. This option has no effect on amplitude zooming via the channel rulers  .Highlight interpolation \n\r\n\rThis option determines whether interpolation is shown in a different color, making it easier to visually distinguish sample points from interpolation. The distinction becomes more meaningful the further you zoom in  .  Show channel names\n\r\n\rThis option determines whether channel names are displayed in the view. Surround audio channels may display speaker names or channel numbers, depending on whether the channels have speakers assigned to them.Max density\n\r\n\rThis advanced option sets the maximum number of samples that will be computed per pixel when displaying audio. It lets you adjust the tradeoff between visual accuracy and speed. Increasing this value makes the view denser (and more accurate) when zoomed out , at the cost of reduced performance. Setting this value too low causes the view to appear sparse when zoomed out; setting it too high makes the user interface sluggish, particularly while zooming out or scrolling. The default is optimal for most situations.

For unlimited undo, check Unlimited; otherwise, uncheck it, and enter the desired number of levels in the edit box. To disable undo, set the number of levels to zero. By default, undo is unlimited. Each open document has its own undo history. Undo states may be stored in memory or on disk, depending on the disk threshold. Note that lowering the number of undo levels while a document is open may truncate its undo history.  Disk threshold \n\r\n\rThis option determines whether the clipboard and undo history are stored in memory or on disk, thereby letting you adjust the corresponding tradeoff between speed and memory usage. When a chunk of audio is cut or copied to the clipboard, the chunk\'s size is compared to the disk threshold. If it\'s smaller than the threshold, the chunk is stored in memory, otherwise it\'s stored in a temporary file on disk. Similarly, when an undo state is generated, i.e. when a chunk of audio is backed up prior to modifying it, the chunk is either stored in memory or on disk, depending on whether its size exceeds the disk threshold. \n\r\n\rThe disk threshold is specified in MB (megabytes), and defaults to zero, which means that by default the clipboard and undo history are always stored on disk, regardless of their size. For 32-bit Windows users, it\'s recommended to leave the disk threshold zero, in order to maximize the amount of memory available for documents, buffers, and other objects that use memory unconditionally. A disk threshold of 10MB has little effect, because only clipboard/undo states up to a minute long (assuming CD-quality audio) utilize memory, and such small data transfers would be acceptably fast even on disk. A disk threshold of 100MB has a more noticeable effect, because now clipboard/undo states up to ten minutes long utilize memory, but the risk of exhausting memory also increases: ten such states could occupy a gigabyte of memory. A disk threshold of 1000MB (1GB) or more effectively forces the clipboard and undo history to always utilize memory. \n\r\n\rThis isn\'t recommended unless 1) you\'re only editing small files, or only doing a small number of edits, 2) huge amounts of physical memory are available, or 3) you\'ve limited undo to only a few levels. Temporary files location\n\r\n\rThis option lets you specify the location of the folder&nbsp;Signal Studio uses for all its temporary files. If \"System default\" is selected, Signal Studio uses the system\'s temporary folder. To specify a different folder, select \"Custom folder\" and either enter the path of the desired folder in the edit box, or press Browse, navigate to the desired folder, and press OK. \n\r\n\rSignal Studio normally stores the clipboard and undo history  in temporary files. These files can consume a considerable amount of disk space, particularly when editing big documents, editing many documents at once, or doing long sequences of edits. If the system temporary folder lacks sufficient free space, e.g. because the system is installed on a small partition, you should consider moving the temporary folder to different partition, or to a different drive. Note that if you move the temporary folder to an external drive, that drive must be accessible whenever&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;is used, and its drive letter must remain consistent. If the custom temporary folder is inaccessible, the error message \"Temporary folder not found\" is shown and the system temporary folder is used instead.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r","Edit tab","scr\\ALG.12.029.htm","&nbsp; 																		      \n\r\n\r Channel Height               \n\r\n\rInitially all the channels in a view have equal heights. To make a channel taller, drag the gutter between it and a neighboring channel. The gutter is the horizontal empty space that separates a pair of channels.                    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\rGUTTER [line between blue&nbsp;rectangle] and&nbsp;double pointed vertical arrow on gutter&nbsp;[red rectangle]             \n\r\n\rPosition the mouse cursor over the gutter, so that the cursor changes to a double-pointed vertical arrow. Now press the left mouse button, and while holding it down, drag the gutter vertically until the channels have the desired heights, and then release the left mouse button.                                                                   \n\r\n\rTo restore a pair of channels to equal heights, double-click the gutter between them. To maximize one channel while minimizing all others, right-click the desired channel and select Maximize Channel in the context menu; this is useful for files with more than two channels. To restore all channels to equal heights, use View/Fit Vertically (Shift+0).  \n\r\n\r         ","Channel Height","scr\\channelheight.htm","&nbsp; 																		      \n\r\n\r Channel Selection               \n\r\n\rChannel selection lets you operate on any subset of the channels in a multi-channel audio file, by excluding channels as desired. Excluded channels are unaffected by the operation, meaning their samples remain                                 untouched. Only the following commands support channel selection:         Amplify,  Fade,  Invert,  Normalize,  Reverse, and   Plugins. For all other commands, channel selection is ignored.         \n\r\n\rBy default, all channels are selected. To toggle a channel\'s selection state (from selected to excluded or vice versa), use Ctrl+left-click, i.e. press the Ctrl key, and while holding it down, left-click anywhere within the channel. To extend the resulting selection state to adjacent channels, drag the cursor over the adjacent channels while continuing to hold down the left mouse button. The cursor changes to a vertical double arrow, indicating drag channel selection mode. This lets you quickly select or exclude a group of adjacent channels, useful when editing surround audio. To select all channels, use the                                                                          Fit Vertically   command (View/Fit Vertically or Shift+0). \n\r\n\rExcluded channels are indicated by an alternate color scheme, which can be             customized. The channel selection needn\'t be contiguous, i.e. it\'s possible to select the first and last channel in a surround file. At least one channel must be selected at all times, and&nbsp;Signal Studio&nbsp;enforces this by modifying your selection if necessary.                                        \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r","Channel Selection","scr\\channelselection.htm","&nbsp; 																		Requirements              Recommended:                                                       \n\r       Windows&nbsp;10                                                            DirectX 11.0                                                            8GB memory or more                                                               Dual-core, Quad-core or   Octa-core CPU                                                                 SSD/HDD&nbsp;with at least 100GB free                                                                  Professional-quality sound card                                                         \n\rMinimum:                                                       \n\r  Windows XP SP2 or Higher                                                             DirectX 9.0                                                            128MB memory                                                            50MB Hard Disk Space&nbsp;                                                          \n\r\n\r\n\r                                                                                                            ","Requirements","scr\\requirements.htm","&nbsp; 																		 Scrolling           \n\r\n\r&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\rIf the audio is sufficiently time-zoomed so that it doesn\'t fit in the window, a horizontal scroll bar appears in the view.
