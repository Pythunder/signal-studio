Signal Studio
===================
An Open-Source Signal Analyzer and Editor with absolute precision, written in C++
----------

Signal Studio is a free, customizable, Open-Source Signal Analyzer and Editor for Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10. Signal Studio allows you to generate and analyze digital signals. It displays the waveform of the signal, on which numerous tasks can be performed. Using plugins and functions, operations like compression, conversion, amplification of weak signals, resampling, introducing delay, applying filters can be performed. It also includes RMS statistics calculation with histogram and a Spectrum Analyzer for analysis of signals.

Unlike other apps, Signal Studio is sample-perfect, meaning samples aren't altered unless they need to be. Editing a portion of a signal/sound file only affects that portion; the rest of the file is untouched. Since speech is also a signal, Signal Studio can also function as a fully functional audio editor.

Blocks of audio can be easily cut and pasted without changing their contents at all. This is especially useful for patching a finished master without corrupting its dither. It also supports audio recording from microphone attached, which can be edited.
